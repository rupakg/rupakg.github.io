      <description>&lt;p&gt;When I was a kid, I was intrigued by the Starship Enterprise&amp;rsquo;s onboard computer featured in the science fiction series Star Trek. Although cheeky at times in it&amp;rsquo;s portrayal of technologies beyond our imagination, the voice-controlled computer always made me wonder. And, here we are in the same lifetime, realiziing similar technolgies - inside our homes, on a small device&amp;hellip; Amazing, I think! ðŸ––

      <description>Over the years, I have built lot of applications and written about software and its practices. Most of the applications were internal facing and hence could not be shared in public. Many articles I wrote were hosted on internal knowledge bases or those sites have evolved over time. Many of those applications and writings were never made public.
Building a personal brand is crucial.
So I have decided to post all my writings here, and publish all my applications on Github.</description>
