      <description>It was an exciting time for us again to be attending DockerCon 2015 this year. It was the 2nd DockerCon, and was way bigger than the first one. Our whole CenturyLink Labs team was there, excited to hear the new announcements from Docker and the rest of the community.
The opening keynote by Ben Golub, CEO of Docker, was followed by Docker&amp;rsquo;s Founder &amp;amp; CTO, Solomon Hykes. The keynote session was followed by a variety of breakout tracks taking place throughout the day.</description>
