      <title>Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP): The Future of AI-Powered Transactions</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;The &lt;strong&gt;Agentic Commerce Protocol (ACP)&lt;/strong&gt; is shaking up how we interact with online stores. Instead of clicking through web pages, imagine instructing an AI agent—like ChatGPT—to shop for you, handling everything from product discovery to checkout, all within a single conversation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;ACP is an open standard that enables secure, seamless transactions between buyers (and their AI agents) and businesses, ensuring each party stays in control and informed throughout the process. It can let an AI agent discover products, validate availability, collect consent, and complete checkout using a retailer’s systems. The retailer is still in charge of the actual transaction details like availability, tax, fulfillment and delivery but the assistants help with the conversation and capturing the customer&amp;rsquo;s intent.

      <title>Agent.ai MCP Server Integration with Claude Desktop: A Step-by-Step Tutorial</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this article, we will set up an Agent.ai MCP Server in Claude Desktop and explore the various possibilities MCP integration offers.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The Model Context Protocol (MCP) significantly advances how Large Language Models (LLMs) interact with external tools and services. At its core, MCP is a standardized communication protocol that enables AI models to seamlessly integrate with various tools, expanding their capabilities beyond basic text generation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MCP works by establishing a structured framework for tools to register their capabilities with LLMs and for LLMs to understand and utilize these tools effectively. When an LLM like Claude encounters a query that could benefit from external tools, it can identify the appropriate MCP-compatible tool, request permission to use it, and incorporate the retrieved information into its response. This creates a more dynamic and capable AI system that can access real-time data, perform complex calculations, or interact with external services.

      <title>Building a web app using AI without the prompt engineering headaches</title>
      <link>https://rupakganguly.com/posts/building-a-web-app-using-ai-without-the-prompt-engineering-headaches/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of AI chatbots, many have been using it to write code and develop apps. But, in reality (at least in my experience), it has been a huge disappointment. The technology is great but works well in the hands of people who know how to use it. A lot has been talked about ‘prompt engineering’ which is at the core of making these AI chatbots respond in a more productive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried creating apps using these AI chatbots but it is a pain. It is a nerve wreaking back and forth prompt writing in chat, and copy/paste in the code base. And, the code never works as expected. It is tough to progressively build on your app using the chatbots because the chatbots are unaware of your full code base.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;This is a multi-part blog series that explores building serverless applications with Stackery. In the &lt;a href=&#34;https://rupakganguly.com/posts/building-serverless-apps-using-stackery/&#34;&gt;first part&lt;/a&gt;, we discussed why Stackery is a great platform for visually building and deploying serverless applications on AWS.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The application we will build is a video processing application that will take a video file dropped into a S3 bucket, along with some user-defined parameters and extract a thumbnail of the specified frame, and store it into another S3 bucket. Since the video processing bit is a long-running process, we will use AWS Fargate to process the video.
