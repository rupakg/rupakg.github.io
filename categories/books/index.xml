      <description>&lt;p&gt;I failed my reading challenge in 2024. I read 32 of 48 books. I &lt;a href=&#34;https://rupakganguly.com/posts/challenge-yourself-into-a-reading-habit/&#34;&gt;read 56 books in 2023 and challenged myself&lt;/a&gt;, and 25 books in 2022. I think I have found my sweet spot: 36 books a year, which is three books a month. I like a challenge, so I always have a stretch goal. I hope to surprise myself!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;But, I feel it is not about the number of books you read. It’s about the discipline and the routine to find time, to read, everyday. Even if it is 10 mins a day.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;If you are thinking of forming a good habit in 2025, start reading. I wrote about my mindset, strategies, challenges, apps, and tools on &lt;a href=&#34;https://rupakganguly.com/posts/how-to-read-24-or-more-books-in-a-year/&#34;&gt;How to Read 24 or More Books in a Year&lt;/a&gt;. Create a reading list, set a reading challenge, read every day, and track your progress. You will thank yourself later.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Challenge Yourself Into a Reading Habit</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my goals every year has been to read at least two books a month, but in 2023 I challenged myself to read 3 books a month. I surprised myself, and I surpassed my expectations by reading 56 books in 2023 with an average of 4.5 books per month.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In 2022, I wrote about &lt;a href=&#34;https://rupakganguly.com/posts/how-to-read-24-or-more-books-in-a-year/&#34;&gt;how to read 24 or more books in a year&lt;/a&gt;. I touched upon tools, apps, and ideas to keep me motivated and read more books. I talked about reading consistently throughout the year, and I found that most of us want to read, but we lack the motivation, discipline, structure, and cadence to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;What would it take you to go from reading zero to one book per month? Or read one more book per month?&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I add to my process for overcoming some hurdles to keep reading throughout the year. I hope this helps you achieve your reading goals for the upcoming year.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;One of my goals every year has been to read at least two books a month. I have accomplished the goal by reading 25 books in 2022, and in the past years. While talking to several of my friends about reading consistently throughout the year, I found out that most of us want to read, but we lack the motivation, discipline, structure, and cadence to keep reading.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;In this article, I describe my process for overcoming some of the hurdles to keep reading throughout the year. I touch upon tools, apps, and ideas to keep us motivated and read more books. Hope this helps you achieve your reading goals for the upcoming year. Happy reading!
