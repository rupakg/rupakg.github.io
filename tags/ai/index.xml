      <title>The Comprehensive Guide to Leveraging AI Tools: From Chatbots to Code Assistants</title>
      <link>https://rupakganguly.com/posts/the-comprehensive-guide-to-leveraging-ai-tools-from-chatbots-to-code-assistants/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI has been the hype since Chat-GPT commoditized the use of its AI chatbot. Soon after, many AI chatbots followed suit, including Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc. Many new applications and startups using these AI APIs sprung up as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of terminologies in play, and it gets confusing very fast. My goal has always been to make complex things easy to understand and break them into small digestible chunks that can be then delved into individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article&amp;rsquo;s core focus is on making AI accessible and practical for everyone, breaking down complex concepts, and emphasizing that AI is not just another tech hype but a revolutionary technology that everyone should understand. I also list some of the AI tools that I have been playing with that will give you an idea of the leverage you can get with using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is a huge revolution, and it should not be limited to the technical folks but should be understood and leveraged by everyone.

      <title>Building a web app using AI without the prompt engineering headaches</title>
      <link>https://rupakganguly.com/posts/building-a-web-app-using-ai-without-the-prompt-engineering-headaches/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of AI chatbots, many have been using it to write code and develop apps. But, in reality (at least in my experience), it has been a huge disappointment. The technology is great but works well in the hands of people who know how to use it. A lot has been talked about ‘prompt engineering’ which is at the core of making these AI chatbots respond in a more productive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried creating apps using these AI chatbots but it is a pain. It is a nerve wreaking back and forth prompt writing in chat, and copy/paste in the code base. And, the code never works as expected. It is tough to progressively build on your app using the chatbots because the chatbots are unaware of your full code base.&lt;/p&gt;

      <description>&lt;p&gt;As I dove into AI head first, I learned a lot. In discussions around AI with several people, I realized that an article rounding up and comparing the major AI chat bots in the ecosystem will help a lot of people, not only understand AI chat bots but encourage them to use these, based on their use cases.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Starting with an introduction, I cover an overview of the AI chat bots, discuss the comparison criteria &amp;amp; their impacts, do a detailed comparison, touch upon their image generation capabilities, illustrate some use cases &amp;amp; best-case scenarios and finally finish off with a section on future developments of the AI chat bots.&lt;/p&gt;
