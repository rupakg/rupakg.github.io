      <description>&lt;p&gt;In this detailed walkthrough, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to build a Ruby on Rails application from scratch using Cline AI powered by the Deepseek model. We&amp;rsquo;ll examine Cline&amp;rsquo;s capabilities in planning, reasoning, and code generation while setting up a Rails app with authentication using Devise.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article provides a hands-on exploration of using Cline in:&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;ul&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Creating a new Rails application with specific configurations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Setting up authentication using Devise&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Working with Cline&amp;rsquo;s Plan and Act modes&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Understanding Cline&amp;rsquo;s interface and cost structure&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;li&gt;Analyzing the strengths and limitations of the Deepseek model&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this journey, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how Cline handles various tasks, from basic setup to error resolution, while keeping track of costs and providing transparent feedback about its operations. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re new to Rails or an experienced developer, this exploration offers valuable insights into how AI can assist in web application development.

      <title>The Comprehensive Guide to Leveraging AI Tools: From Chatbots to Code Assistants</title>
      <link>https://rupakganguly.com/posts/the-comprehensive-guide-to-leveraging-ai-tools-from-chatbots-to-code-assistants/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI has been the hype since Chat-GPT commoditized the use of its AI chatbot. Soon after, many AI chatbots followed suit, including Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc. Many new applications and startups using these AI APIs sprung up as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of terminologies in play, and it gets confusing very fast. My goal has always been to make complex things easy to understand and break them into small digestible chunks that can be then delved into individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article&amp;rsquo;s core focus is on making AI accessible and practical for everyone, breaking down complex concepts, and emphasizing that AI is not just another tech hype but a revolutionary technology that everyone should understand. I also list some of the AI tools that I have been playing with that will give you an idea of the leverage you can get with using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is a huge revolution, and it should not be limited to the technical folks but should be understood and leveraged by everyone.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, AI-powered coding assistants are emerging as powerful tools for accelerating application development. This article explores the capabilities of Bolt.new, an AI coding assistant by StackBlitz, through the practical exercise of building a dynamic Todo List application using Next.js and nothing else but prompts.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The demonstration showcases how Bolt.new can not only generate a basic application from scratch but also iteratively add complex features through simple prompts. We&amp;rsquo;ll examine the assistant&amp;rsquo;s ability to handle various development tasks, from implementing UI components to managing data structures, while also highlighting both its strengths and limitations.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Throughout this hands-on exploration, we&amp;rsquo;ll see how Bolt.new handles different challenges, including error resolution and code refactoring, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI-assisted development and its practical applications in real-world scenarios.
