      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI has been the hype since Chat-GPT commoditized the use of its AI chatbot. Soon after, many AI chatbots followed suit, including Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc. Many new applications and startups using these AI APIs sprung up as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of terminologies in play, and it gets confusing very fast. My goal has always been to make complex things easy to understand and break them into small digestible chunks that can be then delved into individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article&amp;rsquo;s core focus is on making AI accessible and practical for everyone, breaking down complex concepts, and emphasizing that AI is not just another tech hype but a revolutionary technology that everyone should understand. I also list some of the AI tools that I have been playing with that will give you an idea of the leverage you can get with using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is a huge revolution, and it should not be limited to the technical folks but should be understood and leveraged by everyone.
