      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have always taken the time to analyze my thoughts and reflect on the past year. Since last year, I  started writing about my reflections on the past year.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Taking time to assess my yearly objectives, measure my progress, and analyze my time management has become a valuable practice. This exercise consistently brings a fresh perspective for the upcoming year. There&amp;rsquo;s an inherent thrill in both maintaining ongoing projects and embarking on new ventures - it creates anticipation for what&amp;rsquo;s ahead. The process of documenting these thoughts reveals areas needing adjustment and helps identify necessary changes in direction. Moreover, it provides an opportunity to celebrate successes, pinpoint areas for growth, and acknowledge the many blessings for which I&amp;rsquo;m appreciative.

      <description>&lt;p&gt;I have been reflecting on my past year for a few years now, but I did not publish them. This year I wanted to start the trend. Reflecting on my goals for the year, evaluating how I did, and rethinking how I spent my time. It has always provided me with clarity for the next year. Continuing what I started and starting something new has always been exciting for me, something to look forward to. Writing down the reflections, helps me see the gaps and the course corrections I need to make. It also helps me reflect on what went well, and what to improve on, and for all the things I am thankful &amp;amp; grateful for.
