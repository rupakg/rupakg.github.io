      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI-powered development tools are revolutionizing how developers write and maintain code. In this hands-on tutorial, we&amp;rsquo;ll explore how to use Cursor AI Assistant to enhance a simple Todo list application with new features and improvements. Whether you&amp;rsquo;re new to AI coding assistants or looking to level up your development workflow, this guide will show you practical examples of using Cursor AI for iterative development, debugging, and feature implementation.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We&amp;rsquo;ll take an existing Todo list application and walk through adding new functionality like filtering, improving the UI layout, implementing a color theme, and fixing runtime errors - all with the help of Cursor AI. You&amp;rsquo;ll learn how to effectively prompt Cursor AI, review suggested changes, and validate the results. By the end, you&amp;rsquo;ll have a good understanding of how AI assistants like Cursor AI can accelerate your development process while maintaining code quality.

      <title>The Comprehensive Guide to Leveraging AI Tools: From Chatbots to Code Assistants</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;AI has been the hype since Chat-GPT commoditized the use of its AI chatbot. Soon after, many AI chatbots followed suit, including Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc. Many new applications and startups using these AI APIs sprung up as well.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There are a lot of terminologies in play, and it gets confusing very fast. My goal has always been to make complex things easy to understand and break them into small digestible chunks that can be then delved into individually.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The article&amp;rsquo;s core focus is on making AI accessible and practical for everyone, breaking down complex concepts, and emphasizing that AI is not just another tech hype but a revolutionary technology that everyone should understand. I also list some of the AI tools that I have been playing with that will give you an idea of the leverage you can get with using these tools.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;AI is a huge revolution, and it should not be limited to the technical folks but should be understood and leveraged by everyone.

      <title>Building a web app using AI without the prompt engineering headaches</title>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;With the advent of AI chatbots, many have been using it to write code and develop apps. But, in reality (at least in my experience), it has been a huge disappointment. The technology is great but works well in the hands of people who know how to use it. A lot has been talked about ‘prompt engineering’ which is at the core of making these AI chatbots respond in a more productive way.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I have tried creating apps using these AI chatbots but it is a pain. It is a nerve wreaking back and forth prompt writing in chat, and copy/paste in the code base. And, the code never works as expected. It is tough to progressively build on your app using the chatbots because the chatbots are unaware of your full code base.&lt;/p&gt;

      <title>Building an API using the Swagger toolchain</title>
      <link>https://rupakganguly.com/posts/building-an-api-using-the-swagger-toolchain/</link>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;We have been building APIs for ages, with varying standards and design styles - &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP&#34;&gt;SOAP&lt;/a&gt; web services, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC&#34;&gt;gRPC&lt;/a&gt;, &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer&#34;&gt;REST&lt;/a&gt;, and until recently &lt;a href=&#34;https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL&#34;&gt;GraphQL&lt;/a&gt;. Instead of declaring a winning design style, I believe that each one of these design styles stands its ground, and it depends on the use case &lt;a href=&#34;https://nordicapis.com/when-to-use-what-rest-graphql-webhooks-grpc/&#34;&gt;when to use which style&lt;/a&gt;.

      <description>This is a multi-part blog series that will explore building serverless application with Stackery. In this post, the first part in the series, we discuss why Stackery is a great platform for visually building and deploying serverless applications on AWS. We will also look at setting up Stackery, linking an AWS account securely with least privileges, and using a boilerplate template to build and deploy a serverless application to AWS.</description>

      <title>Monitoring Docker Services With Prometheus</title>

      <description>With the advent of the &amp;lsquo;micro-services&amp;rsquo; architecture and the evolving trend for using Docker, monolithic applications are being broken up into smaller and independent services. The idea is to keep the services small so that small groups of developers can work on them, upgrade or patch them quickly, and build &amp;amp; release them continuously. Although that vision is promising, it introduces complexity as the number of services grow. With that also grows the need to monitor these services around the clock, to maintain the healthy functioning of the application.</description>

      <title>Lorry.io: Pathway to Docker Composable Apps</title>
      <link>https://rupakganguly.com/posts/lorry-io-pathway-to-docker-composable-apps/</link>

      <description>Recently, Docker released the Compose tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. The basic component of that tool is the file, docker-compose.yml. We at CenturyLink were big fans of Fig, the basis for Compose and the docker-compose.yml, but always envisioned a utility that could facilitate creating the docker-compose.yml files easily and intuitively.
 From that idea, we are happy to announce our latest project, Lorry.io, a docker-compose.yml validator, editor and composer.</description>

      <title>Managing Application Code in Linux Containers</title>

      <description>Many developers have heard of Linux containers and Docker. But how do you deploy your code to an application running in Linux containers?
Let&amp;rsquo;s go over that in this article, using a very simple yet effective workflow. We&amp;rsquo;ll focus on WordPress, but these principles can be used with Ruby, Python, or even Go applications.
I think most of the time, users need to manage Wordpress for adding/updating plugins, themes etc.</description>
