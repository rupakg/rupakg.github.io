      <description>&lt;p&gt;Containers have been around for a while and Docker commoditized them and brought it into the hands of every developer. The usage was simple and everyone could create a Docker image and run their apps in a container. Docker Swarm and Kubernetes took it further and made it possible for us to deploy and run containerized apps at scale.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The ease of use and small learning curve to entry for creating and running containers had their shortcomings as well. Lots of developers without a deep knowledge of operating systems, systems administration, packaging, and dependency management have been Docker images and containers without much care. This proliferated docker images and containers that had unnecessary packages &amp;amp; dependencies leading to huge image sizes and vulnerabilities. This resulted in increasing the attack surface area for security hacks and decreased performance due to large image download sizes.
