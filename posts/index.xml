      <description>Welcome to my blog!
Over the years, I have built lot of applications and written about software and its practices. Most of the applications were internal facing and hence could not be shared in public. Many articles I wrote were hosted on internal knowledge bases or those sites have evolved over time. Many of those applications and writings were never made public.
So I have decided to post all my writings here, and publish all my applications on Github.</description>
