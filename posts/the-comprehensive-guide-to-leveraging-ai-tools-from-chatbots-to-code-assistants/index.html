    <p>AI has been the hype since Chat-GPT commoditized the use of its AI chatbot. Soon after, many AI chatbots followed suit, including Microsoft Copilot, Google Gemini, Anthropic Claude, etc. Many new applications and startups using these AI APIs sprung up as well.</p>

<p>There are a lot of terminologies in play, and it gets confusing very fast. My goal has always been to make complex things easy to understand and break them into small digestible chunks that can be then delved into individually.</p>

<p>The article&rsquo;s core focus is on making AI accessible and practical for everyone, breaking down complex concepts, and emphasizing that AI is not just another tech hype but a revolutionary technology that everyone should understand. I also list some of the AI tools that I have been playing with that will give you an idea of the leverage you can get with using these tools.</p>

<p>AI is a huge revolution, and it should not be limited to the technical folks but should be understood and leveraged by everyone.

<h2 id="getting-started-with-ai">Getting Started with AI</h2>

<p>It is overwhelming to start anything, but getting started in a large and diverse space like AI has been challenging for many. The AI technology space is advancing at an accelerated speed, so the time to get started is now.</p>

<blockquote>
<p>üëâüèº¬†I wrote an article <a href="https://rupakganguly.com/posts/master-ai-the-ultimate-learning-plan-for-beginners-2024-guide/">Master AI: The Ultimate Learning Plan for Beginners (2024 Guide)</a>, that covers some suggestions, ideas, and a structured learning path for AI beginners, covering everything from programming fundamentals to advanced AI technologies.</p>
</blockquote>

<h2 id="is-ai-just-another-hype">Is AI just another hype?</h2>

<p>I have always been skeptical about hypes and tread carefully around them. It is easy to get lost in the rat race and chase the latest, cool, shiny new thing. I saw a few hype cycles in the 30+ years of my career - E-commerce, SOA (SOAP, XML, 3-tier arch.), Web 2.0 dot com era (blogs, wikis, social networking, crowd-sourcing, RSS, REST, Ajax, web sockets), the Cloud (IaaS, PaaS, SaaS, OpenStack, AWS, Azure, GCP), containers (Docker &amp; Kubernetes), Serverless (Lambda, Serverless Framework), microservices, Web 3.0 (decentralized internet, blockchain, cryptocurrency, smart contracts), the proliferation of JS &amp; UI frameworks, micro-frontends, and now AI‚Ä¶</p>

<p>Not all hype cycles need to be chased or taken off into practical implementations, but the <strong>AI revolution that we are in - is a game changer</strong>. You should pay attention and carve out the space that is <strong>right for you</strong>. There is something valuable for everyone, and it is not just any other tech hype. It will be critical for all of us to understand and leverage AI to remain competitive.</p>

<h2 id="understanding-and-analyzing-ai-chatbots">üí¨¬†Understanding and Analyzing AI Chatbots</h2>

<p>It is hard to get one‚Äôs head around this space, so I wrote an article about <a href="https://rupakganguly.com/posts/comparing-chatgpt-gemini-copilot-and-claude-ai-chatbots/">comparing Chat GPT, Gemini, Copilot and Claude AI Chatbots</a>. The article covers the basics of what these AI chatbots can do and describes the criteria to evaluate these chatbots based on one‚Äôs individual needs. It also covers a high-level comparison of AI chatbots, with a detailed analysis of the strengths and weaknesses of each, highlighting the comparison criteria &amp; their Impacts. It also compares the image-generation capabilities, use cases &amp; best-case scenarios, and future developments &amp; trends in the AI chatbots.</p>

<h2 id="the-ai-tooling-space">The AI Tooling Space</h2>

</ul>

<p>Apart from coding assistants, there are enterprise-focused task-specific assistants like¬†<a href="https://www.harness.io/">Harness</a>‚Äô AI DevOps Engineer and QA Assistant for pipeline generation and test automation, and AI agents like¬†<a href="https://www.all-hands.dev/">All Hands</a> that can perform more end-to-end software development.</p>

<h3 id="support-chatbot-agents">üó£Ô∏è¬†Support Chatbot Agents</h3>

<p>Another use case for AI that has been very useful is the support of chatbot agents. These agents can directly interact with end-user customers and/or support contact center agents to help them.</p>

<p><a href="https://aisera.com/">Aisera</a>,¬†<a href="https://decagon.ai/">Decagon</a>, and¬†<a href="https://sierra.ai/">Sierra</a>‚Äôs agents interact directly with end customers, while¬†<a href="https://www.observe.ai/">Observe AI</a> <strong>s</strong>upports contact center agents with real-time guidance during calls.</p>

<p>There are solutions like¬†<a href="https://www.glean.com/">Glean</a>¬†and¬†<a href="https://www.sanalabs.com/">Sana</a> that can connect to emails, messengers, and document stores and thus enable unified semantic search across disparate systems and deliver AI-powered knowledge management.</p>

<h2 id="so-what-s-the-catch">ü™ùSo what‚Äôs the catch?</h2>

<p>Well, it is not as simple to use these AI tools. Software development is a thoughtful, creative, and complex process. Experienced engineers can do wonders with these AI tools to augment their already creative side. Always remember that the AI tools are just an ‚Äúassistant‚Äù and cannot replace the experience of a hardened engineer. It can, however, accelerate the speed of app development and automate mundane repetitive tasks.</p>

<p>It might seem like magic but experienced engineers review and refactor the code that is generated by the AI tools. They might add error handling, logging, and instrumentation to make the code run efficiently in production. They might add more test cases to the basic unit and integration tests generated by AI. They can foresee potential gaps, issues, and edge cases that the AI missed. They can look beyond the simplistic code generated by the AI tools and enforce best practices, standards &amp; architectural patterns that are internal to their organization.</p>

<p>Be cautious of what code you ‚Äúaccept‚Äù, and make sure you have a robust code review process for reviewing code generated by AI. Make sure what code you let the AI tool access so that your IP is not being leaked by the AI tools that you are using.</p>

<p>üëâüèº¬†<strong>Bottomline</strong>: No! - developers are not becoming redundant, but basic, routine &amp; mundane programming tasks might be automated with the help of AI tools. A quick prototype, boilerplate app starters, UI and styling assist, code for a complex algorithm, assisted code completion, suggested code blocks, and syntax checks - will give you a head start and a quick boost, but you need engineers to drive the app home to production.</p>

<h2 id="summary">Summary</h2>

<p>While the AI space is overwhelming and rapidly advancing, the time to get started is now - waiting is not an option.</p>

<p><strong>Overview &amp; Context</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI is not just another tech hype - it&rsquo;s a game-changing, revolutionary technology that everyone needs to understand and leverage to remain competitive</li>
<li>The AI technology space is advancing rapidly, making it crucial to get started now despite its overwhelming nature</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>AI Tools Landscape</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Major AI chatbots include ChatGPT, Gemini, Copilot, and Claude, each with unique strengths in areas like NLP, coding, and multimodal abilities</li>
<li>Image generation is led by tools like DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Adobe Firefly, and Google&rsquo;s Imagen 3, offering various capabilities for creative work</li>
<li>Notable AI development tools include AI code assistants like GitHub Copilot and Codeium, plus no-code platforms like Replit, Bubble.io, BoltAI, and Cloving.ai for app development</li>
<li>AI code assistants like GitHub Copilot, Codeium, and Cursor help developers with code generation, suggestions, and bug fixes</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Enterprise Applications</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>AI-powered support chatbots and agents are transforming customer service and contact center operations</li>
<li>Enterprise solutions like Glean and Sana enable unified semantic search and AI-powered knowledge management across various systems</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>Important Considerations</strong></p>

<ul>
<li>Security concerns exist with certain AI tools, particularly those requiring uploads of personal data like selfies or voice recordings</li>
<li>While AI tools are powerful assistants, they cannot replace experienced engineers who provide crucial oversight, error handling, and architectural expertise</li>
<li>Organizations must maintain robust code review processes and protect their IP when using AI tools in development</li>
</ul>
