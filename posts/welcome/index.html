Over the years, I have built lot of applications and written about software and its practices. Most of the applications were internal facing and hence could not be shared in public.

So I have decided to post all my writings here, and publish all my applications on Github."/>

    <p><strong>Welcome to my blog!</strong></p>

<p>Over the years, I have built lot of applications and written about software and its practices. Most of the applications were internal facing and hence could not be shared in public. Many articles I wrote were hosted on internal knowledge bases or those sites have evolved over time. Many of those applications and writings were never made public.</p>

<p>So I have decided to post all my writings here, and publish all my applications on <a href="https://github.com/rupakg">Github</a>. The blog posts will also be published on Github, so the content lives even if the host provider sunsets.</p>

<p>I would try to keep a weekly candence of posts and apps, so as to keep your interest rooted. If you have any specific requests for a post or an application, please do let me know in the comments below.</p>

<p>Hope you enjoy!</p>
