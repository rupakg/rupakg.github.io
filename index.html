        <p>One of my goals every year has been to read at least two books a month. I have accomplished the goal by reading 25 books in 2022, and in the past years. While talking to several of my friends about reading consistently throughout the year, I found out that most of us want to read, but we lack the motivation, discipline, structure, and cadence to keep reading.</p>

<p>In this article, I describe my process for overcoming some of the hurdles to keep reading throughout the year. I touch upon tools, apps, and ideas to keep us motivated and read more books. Hope this helps you achieve your reading goals for the upcoming year. Happy reading!

        <p>We are in a terrible crisis, and it has been very stressful for everyone. Some of us are in the frontlines, some of us losing their jobs, some of us in small businesses affected by the shutdown, and some of us forced to work from home. Kids missing school and adapting to online learning, missing out on proms and graduations, missing going out and playing with their friends. Some of us juggling work from home while taking care of our children. And to top it all, fear of catching the virus and be in a precarious health situation. Chaos - to simply put it. But we as humans have survived adversities in the past and we will get over this as well. There is light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>So what can we do with the situation we are in? How can we turn this adversity in our favor and make it a positive thing? How can we utilize the time we got and turn it into something productive and prepare for the future?

        <p>Due to a personal loss in my life, I took a few months of sabbatical to get through it. I got through the holidays with support from my family and friends. It was hard but as the year turned around, I had to move on with my life.</p>

<p>I had a very interesting tenure at Serverless.com and I was looking for a more close interaction with customers at large enterprises. I wanted to remain hands-on technically, but not become a code monkey. I wanted to work on a variety of enterprise use cases yet did not want to become an &ldquo;on-the-road-Mon-to-Fri&rdquo; consultant. I wanted to ideally work remotely and travel occasionally.<br />

        <p>As usual, AWS announced a slew of new services and updates to it&rsquo;s existing services at reInvent 2018. Here are the most significant ones that I am maintaining a list of. I will be updating the list as more services get announced. Werner Vogels is on stage right now announcing new Serverless services and updates.

        <p>This is a multi-part blog series that explores building serverless applications with Stackery. In the <a href="https://rupakganguly.com/posts/building-serverless-apps-using-stackery/">first part</a>, we discussed why Stackery is a great platform for visually building and deploying serverless applications on AWS.</p>

<p>The application we will build is a video processing application that will take a video file dropped into a S3 bucket, along with some user-defined parameters and extract a thumbnail of the specified frame, and store it into another S3 bucket. Since the video processing bit is a long-running process, we will use AWS Fargate to process the video.

Instead of declaring a winning design style, I believe that each one of these design styles stands their ground, and it depends on the use case <a href="https://nordicapis.com/when-to-use-what-rest-graphql-webhooks-grpc/">when to use which style</a>.

In this post, the first part in the series, we discuss why Stackery is a great platform for visually building and deploying serverless applications on AWS. We will also look at setting up Stackery, linking an AWS account securely with least privileges, and using a boilerplate template to build and deploy a serverless application to AWS.

        <p>When I was a kid, I was intrigued by the Starship Enterprise&rsquo;s onboard computer featured in the science fiction series Star Trek. Although cheeky at times in it&rsquo;s portrayal of technologies beyond our imagination, the voice-controlled computer always made me wonder. And, here we are in the same lifetime, realiziing similar technolgies - inside our homes, on a small device&hellip; Amazing, I think! 🖖

        Over the years, I have built lot of applications and written about software and its practices. Most of the applications were internal facing and hence could not be shared in public. Many articles I wrote were hosted on internal knowledge bases or those sites have evolved over time. Many of those applications and writings were never made public.
Building a personal brand is crucial.
So I have decided to post all my writings here, and publish all my applications on Github.

        With the advent of the &lsquo;micro-services&rsquo; architecture and the evolving trend for using Docker, monolithic applications are being broken up into smaller and independent services. The idea is to keep the services small so that small groups of developers can work on them, upgrade or patch them quickly, and build &amp; release them continuously. Although that vision is promising, it introduces complexity as the number of services grow. With that also grows the need to monitor these services around the clock, to maintain the healthy functioning of the application.

        It was an exciting time for us again to be attending DockerCon 2015 this year. It was the 2nd DockerCon, and was way bigger than the first one. Our whole CenturyLink Labs team was there, excited to hear the new announcements from Docker and the rest of the community.
The opening keynote by Ben Golub, CEO of Docker, was followed by Docker&rsquo;s Founder &amp; CTO, Solomon Hykes. The keynote session was followed by a variety of breakout tracks taking place throughout the day.

        Recently, Docker released the Compose tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. The basic component of that tool is the file, docker-compose.yml. We at CenturyLink were big fans of Fig, the basis for Compose and the docker-compose.yml, but always envisioned a utility that could facilitate creating the docker-compose.yml files easily and intuitively.
 From that idea, we are happy to announce our latest project, Lorry.io, a docker-compose.yml validator, editor and composer.
