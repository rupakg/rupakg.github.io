        <p>In the rapidly evolving landscape of software development, AI-powered coding assistants are emerging as powerful tools for accelerating application development. This article explores the capabilities of Bolt.new, an AI coding assistant by StackBlitz, through the practical exercise of building a dynamic Todo List application using Next.js and nothing else but prompts.</p>

<p>The demonstration showcases how Bolt.new can not only generate a basic application from scratch but also iteratively add complex features through simple prompts. We&rsquo;ll examine the assistant&rsquo;s ability to handle various development tasks, from implementing UI components to managing data structures, while also highlighting both its strengths and limitations.</p>

<p>Throughout this hands-on exploration, we&rsquo;ll see how Bolt.new handles different challenges, including error resolution and code refactoring, providing valuable insights into the current state of AI-assisted development and its practical applications in real-world scenarios.

        <p>It is overwhelming to start anything, but getting started in a large and diverse space like AI has been challenging for many. The AI technology space is advancing at an accelerated speed, so the time to get started is now. This article is a set of recommendations, suggestions, and ideas for an AI learning plan for beginners. I hope you find this article useful if you have been wondering when and how to start.</p>

<p>The article&rsquo;s core focus is on providing a structured learning path for AI beginners, covering everything from programming fundamentals to advanced AI technologies.

        <p>With the advent of AI chatbots, many have been using it to write code and develop apps. But, in reality (at least in my experience), it has been a huge disappointment. The technology is great but works well in the hands of people who know how to use it. A lot has been talked about ‘prompt engineering’ which is at the core of making these AI chatbots respond in a more productive way.</p>

<p>I have tried creating apps using these AI chatbots but it is a pain. It is a nerve wreaking back and forth prompt writing in chat, and copy/paste in the code base. And, the code never works as expected. It is tough to progressively build on your app using the chatbots because the chatbots are unaware of your full code base.</p>

        <p>As I dove into AI head first, I learned a lot. In discussions around AI with several people, I realized that an article rounding up and comparing the major AI chat bots in the ecosystem will help a lot of people, not only understand AI chat bots but encourage them to use these, based on their use cases.</p>

<p>Starting with an introduction, I cover an overview of the AI chat bots, discuss the comparison criteria &amp; their impacts, do a detailed comparison, touch upon their image generation capabilities, illustrate some use cases &amp; best-case scenarios and finally finish off with a section on future developments of the AI chat bots.</p>

        <p>I have been reflecting on my past year for a few years now, but I did not publish them. This year I wanted to start the trend. Reflecting on my goals for the year, evaluating how I did, and rethinking how I spent my time. It has always provided me with clarity for the next year. Continuing what I started and starting something new has always been exciting for me, something to look forward to. Writing down the reflections, helps me see the gaps and the course corrections I need to make. It also helps me reflect on what went well, and what to improve on, and for all the things I am thankful &amp; grateful for.

        <p>One of my goals every year has been to read at least two books a month, but in 2023 I challenged myself to read 3 books a month. I surprised myself, and I surpassed my expectations by reading 56 books in 2023 with an average of 4.5 books per month.</p>

<p>In 2022, I wrote about <a href="/posts/how-to-read-24-or-more-books-in-a-year/">how to read 24 or more books in a year</a>. I touched upon tools, apps, and ideas to keep me motivated and read more books. I talked about reading consistently throughout the year, and I found that most of us want to read, but we lack the motivation, discipline, structure, and cadence to keep reading.</p>

<p><em>What would it take you to go from reading zero to one book per month? Or read one more book per month?</em></p>

<p>In this article, I add to my process for overcoming some hurdles to keep reading throughout the year. I hope this helps you achieve your reading goals for the upcoming year.

But, instead of using the Strapi Dashboard Admin UI to manage content, we will take a deep dive into exploring how we can programmatically create content types, manage content, and consume the content via the Strapi CLI and APIs. We will also look at the anatomy of the Strapi app that is created and explore some of the functionalities that it provides out-of-the-box.

        <p>In this article, we will create a Strapi-powered app, to manage content using the Strapi CMS. To manage the content, we will use the Strapi Dashboard Admin UI to create the content types, create content data, set roles and permissions, and then expose the content via automatically generated APIs. Finally, we will access the APIs to retrieve the content data.

        <p>One of my goals every year has been to read at least two books a month. I have accomplished the goal by reading 25 books in 2022, and in the past years. While talking to several of my friends about reading consistently throughout the year, I found out that most of us want to read, but we lack the motivation, discipline, structure, and cadence to keep reading.</p>

<p>In this article, I describe my process for overcoming some of the hurdles to keep reading throughout the year. I touch upon tools, apps, and ideas to keep us motivated and read more books. Hope this helps you achieve your reading goals for the upcoming year. Happy reading!

        <p>We are in a terrible crisis, and it has been very stressful for everyone. Some of us are on the front lines, some of us losing our jobs, some of us are in small businesses affected by the shutdown, and some of us are forced to work from home. Kids are missing school and adapting to online learning, missing out on proms and graduations, are missing going out and playing with their friends. Some of us are juggling work from home while taking care of our children. And to top it all, fear of catching the virus and being in a precarious health situation. Chaos - to simply put it. But we as humans have survived adversities in the past and we will get over this as well. There is light at the end of the tunnel.</p>

<p>So what can we do with the situation we are in? How can we turn this adversity in our favor and make it a positive thing? How can we utilize the time we got and turn it into something productive and prepare for the future?

        <p>Due to a personal loss in my life, I took a few months of sabbatical to get through it. I got through the holidays with support from my family and friends. It was hard but as the year turned around, I had to move on with my life.</p>

<p>I had a very interesting tenure at Serverless.com and I was looking for a more close interaction with customers at large enterprises. I wanted to remain hands-on technically, but not become a code monkey. I wanted to work on a variety of enterprise use cases yet did not want to become an &ldquo;on-the-road-Mon-to-Fri&rdquo; consultant. I wanted to ideally work remotely and travel occasionally.<br />

I will be updating the list as more services get announced. Werner Vogels is on stage right now announcing new Serverless services and updates.

        <p>This is a multi-part blog series that explores building serverless applications with Stackery. In the <a href="https://rupakganguly.com/posts/building-serverless-apps-using-stackery/">first part</a>, we discussed why Stackery is a great platform for visually building and deploying serverless applications on AWS.</p>

<p>The application we will build is a video processing application that will take a video file dropped into a S3 bucket, along with some user-defined parameters and extract a thumbnail of the specified frame, and store it into another S3 bucket. Since the video processing bit is a long-running process, we will use AWS Fargate to process the video.

        <p>We have been building APIs for ages, with varying standards and design styles - <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SOAP">SOAP</a> web services, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GRPC">gRPC</a>, <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Representational_state_transfer">REST</a>, and until recently <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GraphQL">GraphQL</a>. Instead of declaring a winning design style, I believe that each one of these design styles stands its ground, and it depends on the use case <a href="https://nordicapis.com/when-to-use-what-rest-graphql-webhooks-grpc/">when to use which style</a>.

        This is a multi-part blog series that will explore building serverless application with Stackery. In this post, the first part in the series, we discuss why Stackery is a great platform for visually building and deploying serverless applications on AWS. We will also look at setting up Stackery, linking an AWS account securely with least privileges, and using a boilerplate template to build and deploy a serverless application to AWS.

        <p>When I was a kid, I was intrigued by the Starship Enterprise&rsquo;s onboard computer featured in the science fiction series Star Trek. Although cheeky at times in its portrayal of technologies beyond our imagination, the voice-controlled computer always made me wonder. And, here we are in the same lifetime, realizing similar technologies - inside our homes, on a small device&hellip; Amazing, I think! 🖖

        Over the years, I have built a lot of applications and written about software and its practices. Most of the applications were internally facing and hence could not be shared in public. Many articles I wrote were hosted on internal knowledge bases or those sites have evolved. Many of those applications and writings were never made public.
Building a personal brand is crucial.
So I have decided to post all my writings here and publish all my applications on Github.

        With the advent of the &lsquo;micro-services&rsquo; architecture and the evolving trend for using Docker, monolithic applications are being broken up into smaller and independent services. The idea is to keep the services small so that small groups of developers can work on them, upgrade or patch them quickly, and build &amp; release them continuously. Although that vision is promising, it introduces complexity as the number of services grow. With that also grows the need to monitor these services around the clock, to maintain the healthy functioning of the application.

        It was an exciting time for us again to be attending DockerCon 2015 this year. It was the 2nd DockerCon, and was way bigger than the first one. Our whole CenturyLink Labs team was there, excited to hear the new announcements from Docker and the rest of the community.
The opening keynote by Ben Golub, CEO of Docker, was followed by Docker&rsquo;s Founder &amp; CTO, Solomon Hykes. The keynote session was followed by a variety of breakout tracks taking place throughout the day.

        Recently, Docker released the Compose tool for defining and running complex applications with Docker. The basic component of that tool is the file, docker-compose.yml. We at CenturyLink were big fans of Fig, the basis for Compose and the docker-compose.yml, but always envisioned a utility that could facilitate creating the docker-compose.yml files easily and intuitively.
 From that idea, we are happy to announce our latest project, Lorry.io, a docker-compose.yml validator, editor and composer.

        Many developers have heard of Linux containers and Docker. But how do you deploy your code to an application running in Linux containers?
Let&rsquo;s go over that in this article, using a very simple yet effective workflow. We&rsquo;ll focus on WordPress, but these principles can be used with Ruby, Python, or even Go applications.
I think most of the time, users need to manage Wordpress for adding/updating plugins, themes etc.
